# ai_engineering_bootcamp
**Project Overview**:
In this bootcamp project, weâ€™ll build an AI assistant that helps users explore Amazon products using real product data like descriptions and reviews. It will start as a basic Q&A tool and grow week by week into a more advanced system that can act like an intelligent agent. 
The **goal** is to build real AI skills while adding functionality step by step. By the end, a working, ready-to-use AI application will be built.
