These are great. I just ordered a second pair. I love these.\\\\n- B0BRMV85ZK: Crazy comfortable Awesome product. Definitely recommend\\\\n- B0B658CT5S: Great earbuds Great price Fast delivery,Great price, easy to setup, high quality sounds. very good seller. These are probably the best earphones I\\'ve ever had. The noise canceling works great and the battery life is outstanding. Recommend to buy .\\\\n- B0BRMV85ZK: Surprisingly Good Headphones! These headphones have their flaws, but they exceeded my expectations, especially at this price point! They are comfortable to the point of forgetting you’re wearing them, and the frame is bendable at the neck and over the ear, so it can be customized for any wearer. It’s handy that the headphones don’t interfere at all with glasses! Even though lightweight, these feel secure, without worry as to whether or not they will fall off during activities.<br /><br />Without fiddling around with equalization, these headphones are all about Midrange and Treble, painfully so. I don’t expect much in the way of punchy Bass from air conduction headphones, and these are no exception. I used AudioCheck to put these through their paces and they only get down to 60 Hz without distortion but do go reliably to 14 KHz. So, they’re not audiophile quality, but again, I didn’t expect them to be. But I was able to use the equalizer on my phone to adjust frequency response to my liking, and they actually sound quite good! No matter whether Rock or Rachmaninoff, they perform equally well. I can also hear ambient sounds well if I keep the volume at midrange or lower, but like most air conduction headphones, there is noticeable sound leakage.<br /><br />These only fall seriously short in the microphone department. Mic pickup is not good – I used these with my voice assistant, and it was almost as if I were speaking a foreign language! Call quality is acceptable in a quiet environment, but any ambient noise degrades that quickly. As these headphones are air conduction style, there is no physical noise cancellation.<br /><br />The controls could have better tactile feel to them, but once I got used to them, everything works well. It’s nice to be able to control volume from the headphones without having to dig my phone out of a pocket to do that. Call functions – Answer, End, Mute – and track controls all work well.<br /><br />It’s a nice touch that Aisizon includes a zippered case, charging cord and microfiber cleaning cloth with these headphones. It’s those extras that go a long way towards convenience and feeling good about a purchase!\\\\n- B0B658CT5S: Amazing! have a longer bluetooth range, product well received, easy to use without complicated operation, clear mids, stunning treble, powerful bass, has noise canceling using noise cancellation, Digital LED display shows power level, Equipped with type C cable for fast and stable charging, very light and convenient, over all I have no complaints for this product, I like it.\\\\n- B09NZNP8Z3: These are actually pretty good. I love the battery display feature.  For the money, this was a good purchase.  Fine print: I\\'m  not listening to fine music, just basic PC stuff.\\\\n- B0C85LNB75: AMAZING SOUND Totally love the sound totally recommended amazing product great quality long life battery A++++\\\\n- B0BRMV85ZK: Great value I\\'ve used these headphones several times now and feel like I can assess them fairly. Overall, for my purpose, they\\'re great quality for the price. I have a different brand of over ear conduction headphones that I\\'m fairly happy with and was going to order another pair to keep at a second location. But I decided to try this brand instead so I could compare them.<br />SOUND: I\\'ve only used these to listen to audiobooks so far and find the sound great for that purpose. I rarely listen to music using headphones, but will update my review if I do and have anything to add.<br />COMFORT: I find them pretty comfortable, with one annoyance. The part that goes around the back of the head is pretty stiff, and depending what I\\'m wearing that part can be a bit uncomfortable. I would prefer it to be more lax so it wouldn\\'t catch on my collar or in my hair. The other pair I have doesn\\'t do that. But most importantly, they are comfortable around the ears, which is why I opted for over the ear headphones in the first place. I\\'ve tried various ear buds and they either don\\'t stay in or are extremely uncomfortable. Regular headphones are more comfortable for me, but sometimes feel too heavy or sweaty or awkward. Over the ear headphones are perfect for me. I do need to sometimes readjust them as they slip around a bit, but that\\'s a very minor inconvenience.<br />BATTERY: I\\'m not really sure on this one. The battery life is OK, and it\\'s nice that they\\'re rechargeable. But when the battery is running low, there is an annoying beeping, then after a few times they go dead. It would be nice to have an actual percentage warning. Last time I used them it showed plenty of battery power indicated on my phone, but then they ran out shortly into my walk. So I don\\'t know if what was shown on my phone wasn\\'t accurate or if they suddenly drained very quickly . My solution for this will be to charge them more regularly, though I\\'m not sure if that will shorten the life of them?\\\\n- B0B658CT5S: Great product The sound is great, the touch control function is so handy and it last long. Highly recommended\\\\n- B0B658CT5S: Love these Very good quality all around for the price would recommend\\\\n- B09W5DB49K: Good value and product A nice value compared to other brands\\\\n- B0B658CT5S: Buy these Buy these earphones. They are awesome especially the noise cancellation feature. I just love them totally. bass is awesome as well. You wont be disappointed\\\\n- B0C85LNB75: Best ever and most comfortable buds! I\\'ve owned a few pair of the around-the-ear earbuds, but these are the best ever! The sound quality is wonderful and they are the most comfortable buds I\\'ve ever owned. The case is clear on top, so you can easily see the battery life, which, by the way, is very long. They pair instantly when you open the case, once you\\'ve paired them originally. Buying these is really a no brainer! I highly recommend them!!\\\\n- B0B658CT5S: very useful bluetooth headset Ten accessorise  are complete and easy to use . you and i deserve it\\\\n- B0BRMV85ZK: Good sound quality and easy to use!

These are probably the best earphones I\\'ve ever had. The noise canceling works great and the battery life is outstanding. Recommend to buy .\\\\n- B0BRMV85ZK: Surprisingly Good Headphones! These headphones have their flaws, but they exceeded my expectations, especially at this price point! They are comfortable to the point of forgetting you’re wearing them, and the frame is bendable at the neck and over the ear, so it can be customized for any wearer. It’s handy that the headphones don’t interfere at all with glasses! Even though lightweight, these feel secure, without worry as to whether or not they will fall off during activities.<br /><br />Without fiddling around with equalization, these headphones are all about Midrange and Treble, painfully so. I don’t expect much in the way of punchy Bass from air conduction headphones, and these are no exception. I used AudioCheck to put these through their paces and they only get down to 60 Hz without distortion but do go reliably to 14 KHz. So, they’re not audiophile quality, but again, I didn’t expect them to be. But I was able to use the equalizer on my phone to adjust frequency response to my liking, and they actually sound quite good! No matter whether Rock or Rachmaninoff, they perform equally well. I can also hear ambient sounds well if I keep the volume at midrange or lower, but like most air conduction headphones, there is noticeable sound leakage.<br /><br />These only fall seriously short in the microphone department. Mic pickup is not good – I used these with my voice assistant, and it was almost as if I were speaking a foreign language! Call quality is acceptable in a quiet environment, but any ambient noise degrades that quickly. As these headphones are air conduction style, there is no physical noise cancellation.<br /><br />The controls could have better tactile feel to them, but once I got used to them, everything works well. It’s nice to be able to control volume from the headphones without having to dig my phone out of a pocket to do that. Call functions – Answer, End, Mute – and track controls all work well.<br /><br />It’s a nice touch that Aisizon includes a zippered case, charging cord and microfiber cleaning cloth with these headphones. It’s those extras that go a long way towards convenience and feeling good about a purchase!\\\\n- B0B658CT5S: Amazing! have a longer bluetooth range, product well received, easy to use without complicated operation, clear mids, stunning treble, powerful bass, has noise canceling using noise cancellation, Digital LED display shows power level, Equipped with type C cable for fast and stable charging, very light and convenient, over all I have no complaints for this product, I like it.\\\\n- B09NZNP8Z3: These are actually pretty good. I love the battery display feature.  For the money, this was a good purchase.  Fine print: I\\'m  not listening to fine music, just basic PC stuff.\\\\n- B0C85LNB75: AMAZING SOUND Totally love the sound totally recommended amazing product great quality long life battery A++++\\\\n- B0BRMV85ZK: Great value I\\'ve used these headphones several times now and feel like I can assess them fairly. Overall, for my purpose, they\\'re great quality for the price. I have a different brand of over ear conduction headphones that I\\'m fairly happy with and was going to order another pair to keep at a second location. But I decided to try this brand instead so I could compare them.<br />SOUND: I\\'ve only used these to listen to audiobooks so far and find the sound great for that purpose. I rarely listen to music using headphones, but will update my review if I do and have anything to add.<br />COMFORT: I find them pretty comfortable, with one annoyance. The part that goes around the back of the head is pretty stiff, and depending what I\\'m wearing that part can be a bit uncomfortable. I would prefer it to be more lax so it wouldn\\'t catch on my collar or in my hair. The other pair I have doesn\\'t do that. But most importantly, they are comfortable around the ears, which is why I opted for over the ear headphones in the first place. I\\'ve tried various ear buds and they either don\\'t stay in or are extremely uncomfortable. Regular headphones are more comfortable for me, but sometimes feel too heavy or sweaty or awkward. Over the ear headphones are perfect for me. I do need to sometimes readjust them as they slip around a bit, but that\\'s a very minor inconvenience.<br />BATTERY: I\\'m not really sure on this one. The battery life is OK, and it\\'s nice that they\\'re rechargeable. But when the battery is running low, there is an annoying beeping, then after a few times they go dead. It would be nice to have an actual percentage warning. Last time I used them it showed plenty of battery power indicated on my phone, but then they ran out shortly into my walk. So I don\\'t know if what was shown on my phone wasn\\'t accurate or if they suddenly drained very quickly . My solution for this will be to charge them more regularly, though I\\'m not sure if that will shorten the life of them?\\\\n- B0B658CT5S: Great product The sound is great, the touch control function is so handy and it last long.

I\\'ve owned a few pair of the around-the-ear earbuds, but these are the best ever! The sound quality is wonderful and they are the most comfortable buds I\\'ve ever owned. The case is clear on top, so you can easily see the battery life, which, by the way, is very long. They pair instantly when you open the case, once you\\'ve paired them originally.

I’m very picky about my audio and video purchases. I read the reviews carefully and compare similar items before making a purchase.  Purchasing the KLIM Boombox B4 was a great pick!!! I read all the product selling points, but they all exceeded my expectations. The sound and volume are more than adequate and clear with enough bass thanks to the equalizer settings. Volume range goes to 30 but is great at 20 or above enough to appreciate what you are hearing. Had an issue with the  Bluetooth mode, but KLIM customer service resolved it in record time, the fastest I’ve ever experienced with any company! The 5 year warranty for this product should be copied by other companies if they think the quality of their product is worth it. I would absolutely buy this item again and I recommend it as a best buy!\\\\n- B0C2TYZ5LF: Great Digital Frame! The setup was very easy.

Would perhaps be better if it utilized USB or has the brick elsewhere to fit in better tight spaces<br /><br />There are lots of other features here that I haven\\\\\\'t gone over, but these are the main things. Overall I\\\\\\'m very happy with this.  My family has wanted one of these for a while and we are excited to finally have one. I\\\\\\'d recommend this to anyone wanting to explore their first digital photo frame.  The only thing i\\\\\\'d like to be different is to have a larger one, lol\\\\n- B0BXNK6B1Q: Versatile boombox with average sound quality [[VIDEOID:6ed5937277d106df9626614c81946ba4]] I ordered this because we recently found that we didn\\\\\\'t have a CD player or radio anymore and still have a need for those. I found this boombox to be reminiscent of the ones that I remember from when I was younger with some nice new features, Bluetooth and USB capability. It’s also really nice that it comes with a remote control and they include the batteries needed!<br /><br />I like that this can be used cordless so we can take it to the pool or the beach but I haven\\\\\\'t yet tested how well that works or how long the battery life is.<br /><br />The sound quality is just meh. It\\\\\\'s fine but can\\\\\\'t compete with my Bluetooth speakers.<br /><br />The size is larger than the other devices that we use but the CD player necessitates a larger size plus it has a rechargeable battery without being too heavy so I\\\\\\'m fine with it.<br /><br />I found that the radio tuner works well... it\\\\\\'s a digital tuner with a knob. I found that it did locate radio stations automatically if I spun the knob quickly enough. I noticed that the collapsible antenna was necessary for a clear signal from some radio stations but not most.<br /><br />I like that the LCD display is backlit when the unit is on. It definitely made the screen easier to see.<br /><br />I included photos of the user manual because it shows all of the many features and functions of this boombox. I love that it accepts external audio from different sources via Bluetooth and USB. It has an AUX output for listening via headphones.<br /><br />Overall, this boombox has a lot of useful features that I appreciate but I wish it had better sound.\\\\n- B0C2TYZ5LF: Great features but some display inadequacies Quick Summary:<br />Pros:<br />• Wi-fi uploadable files<br />• Multi-window display<br />• Touch screen<br />• Weather feature<br />• Timer and occupancy sensor<br />• User picture upload control<br />• Remote picture uploads<br />Cons:<br />• Color inaccurate<br />• Narrow viewing angle<br />• Low-resolution screen<br /><br />I received this digital picture frame hoping to put our vacation pictures on it.  It was nicely boxed and had both a  quick start guide and a more detailed user manual.<br />This frame has some excellent features, some of which my previous digital frames lacked.<br />WI-FI capabilities.  After installing a free app on our mobile phones, both my GF and I were able to upload pictures.  Giving this frame as a gift and being able to upload images in the background remotely is a feature I have always wanted.  You can load up to 50 at once, which takes a short time, and once uploaded, the frame downloads from the cloud server.  Another item I liked was that I could control whose pictures were displayed.<br />There is the ability to show 1,2,3, or 4 pictures at once; none of my other frames would do this.<br />The local weather information can also be displayed.  There are automatic on and off settings, plus an auto turn on when it senses a person in the room.<br />It has all the standard digital frame features like built-in memory, USB thumb drive capability, video file playback, audio capabilities, and a wired USB connection.<br />There were a few display items that were a deal-breaker for me.  The color reproduction was not accurate.  All my pictures looked chromatically desaturated and tinted towards yellow-green.  I’ve scrutinized several photos and found they were not faithfully reproduced on this frame compared to my desktop computer and my phone.  The display also has a narrow viewing angle.  For example, suppose you are off more than 45 degrees from the center; the picture brightness and chroma saturation/tint change dramatically.  Typically this is caused by the LCD panel.  I read other reviews that pointed out the resolution- 1280x800 is too low, and in most cases, I would agree, but for this application, either using this on a wall or desk, I believe I could deal with that issue, as I am at least 2-3ft away from the frame most of the time.  The low resolution isn’t as noticeable, especially if multiple images are up.<br />Really like all the features this digital display offers, but I cannot give this high marks due to the display chromaticity issues.\\\\n- B0C2TYZ5LF: Looks great!

This is definitely a five star video player and the customer service from the company I-Geek is so good you can’t pass up this opportunity to purchase the right player from the start.

Not only that but the Quality of the screen was very high.\\\\n- B09ZYF8GQQ: Impressive! This Video player is ridiculously easy to use. Would be especially great for families with younger children.  It has power cords for either a regular wall outlet or the car’s 12v (cigarette lighter), and the battery easily lasts through a movie anyway.  I use it to watch movies at home without bothering the wife.  Since most laptops now don\\\\\\'t even have DVD drives this comes in really handy!  Highly recommended.\\\\n- B0C2TYZ5LF: 10 out of 10 This is a new and improved digital photo frame. So much better than the ones I have seen that family have had for years and years. It is a 10\" frame which is perfect. Not too big but not too small. It is a touch screen and gives me tablet vibes. It has 32 GB of internal storage which is enough for all my photo\\\\\\'s and I have a lot.<br />I really like the option to download the app and load images on there straight from my mobile device. I also like that you can play videos as well on this frame. I really like also that it has your local weather and clock as well on the home screen.<br />The only downfall I saw was that the directions weren\\\\\\'t as good as I would have liked. It has a basic how-to, but you need to know how to work electronics like this and play around a bit to figure it out on your own.  And may not be the best gift for someone older or not tech-savvy.<br />But for what it is I would recommend it to others. I love that I am able to put it on a shelf or hang it up as well. There are so many great things to say about this.\\\\n- B0C2TYZ5LF: Works well, nice extra options, flexable methods to load photos. Overall this frame does what most people would buy it for. The frame is bright enough to be seen well in most situations.  It has options for how long each picture is displayed, several simple transistions to choose from, and to have the pictures zoom up and crop to fill the screen, or to be \"letterboxed\" to show the entire picture on the screen.<br /><br />The frame can be powered by the included Power adapter plugged into the power port, or powered via the microUSB port using a phone charger or similar. If it does not get enough power from the microUSB port it will \"stall\" and not finish booting.<br /><br />Setting up the frame is easy, it is a touch screen, it walks you through connecting to your WiFi, naming the frame, and presents a QR code to get the software, as well as a QR code that changes on a regular basis to \"pair\" your phone with the frame so you have control and some security over how/who can upload pictures to the frame.<br /><br />Options for getting pictures onto the frame are to:<br />* Use the app, copying pictures directly from your phone to the frame (your phone and frame must be on the same WiFi network while yo do this.)<br />* Email, you can have frame and associated service setup to accept photos as attachments via email.<br />* Direct connect to computer, Using the micro USB port on the frame you can connect the frame to a compiuter, it shows up similar to a digital camera allowing you to copy pictures directly to the frame.<br />* MicroSD card, you can put pictures on a microSD card, and just plug the card into the frame.<br />* USB drive, the frame has a USB type A (USB 2.0?) you can put pictures on a USB drive and plug it in.<br /><br /> However, It does *NOT* have a \"cloud storage\" mode where you could give it to grandpa/grandma and just upload photos to the cloud that the frame will display. However you could set your own email address  up as \"approved\" and email pictures to the frame as attachments.<br /><br />When using the MicroSD card and USB drive, you can have the frame copy the pictues into it\\\\\\'s internal storage (16 GB) or simply display pictues directly from the plugged in drives.<br /><br />The frame can display video and sound as well. The sound quality is fair (missing a lot of bass and tinny, hey, it\\\\\\'s a picture frame, not a sound system) the volume does not go extremely high, but was slightly louder than I expected.<br /><br />It also claims to play videos. At 10\" with quite tinny sound lacking a lot of bass, I\\\\\\'d not call it a cinematic experience, but for showing short videos taken with a camera phone it\\\\\\'s quite good. Videos are limited to 200 Mb each.<br /><br />The frame includes a motion sensor, so it can turn itself off when no one is near to save power. And it senses it\\\\\\'s orientation to display photos correctly when rotated on it\\\\\\'s side or upside down.<br /><br />Pictures that are not oriented correctly can be rotated while being displayed, and the frame remembers the fix so the picutre will from then on be right side up.<br /><br />Storage: 16 GB is quite a bit for photo storage, and the option to add up to an additional 32 GB in the form of a microSD card is nice. (How I use it, I put my pics on a micros SD card, plug it in and away it goes.)<br /><br />It does have the option to create folders of pictures so you can have seperate slideshows that it can cycle through; pictures of the kids for when grandparents visit, or just scenery when you are tired of the kids?<br /><br />Overall, it\\\\\\'s a good solid product, it works as advertised with some nice extra features. I really like it on my desk at work to show pics of my family and kids.\\\\n- B0BXNK6B1Q: Great CD player This is a great little unit. It has good sound, is easy to use and we like that it has AM & FM radio. With USB capabilities a big plus!<br /><br />We were very impressed with the company literature and guarantee. Very personalized information given.<br /><br />We will definitely keep this company in mind for future purchases and for sure highly recommend.\\\\n- B0BXNK6B1Q: This is not your mother’s boombox! This new boombox has so much more than the boomboxes I grew up with. It does have your standard a.m. FM radio and the CD player. It also has a USB port that you could use for other music services. And it has a rechargeable battery so it can be portable and not worry about having to buy new batteries constantly. The sound quality is OK, it’s not Bose though. But for the price it is a great value.<br />The thing I like about it most though is that the company is very honest, and funny. They included instructions in five different languages, as well as thank you notes in three different languages. It was the thank you notes that got my attention. If you look at the picture, you can see that it says “if you were in a hurry you can stop reading here otherwise keep going. This document is of absolutely no practical use, but we hope you will find it entertaining, and maybe even bring a smile to your face! If you experienced any issues please do not do contact us at…”<br />Well, I did find it entertaining and it did bring a smile to my face!

I really like it on my desk at work to show pics of my family and kids.\\\\n- B0BXNK6B1Q: Great CD player This is a great little unit. It has good sound, is easy to use and we like that it has AM & FM radio. With USB capabilities a big plus!<br /><br />We were very impressed with the company literature and guarantee. Very personalized information given.<br /><br />We will definitely keep this company in mind for future purchases and for sure highly recommend.\\\\n- B0BXNK6B1Q: This is not your mother’s boombox! This new boombox has so much more than the boomboxes I grew up with. It does have your standard a.m. FM radio and the CD player. It also has a USB port that you could use for other music services. And it has a rechargeable battery so it can be portable and not worry about having to buy new batteries constantly. The sound quality is OK, it’s not Bose though. But for the price it is a great value.<br />The thing I like about it most though is that the company is very honest, and funny. They included instructions in five different languages, as well as thank you notes in three different languages. It was the thank you notes that got my attention. If you look at the picture, you can see that it says “if you were in a hurry you can stop reading here otherwise keep going. This document is of absolutely no practical use, but we hope you will find it entertaining, and maybe even bring a smile to your face! If you experienced any issues please do not do contact us at…”<br />Well, I did find it entertaining and it did bring a smile to my face! Thank you KLIM!\\\\n- B0C2TYZ5LF: Absolutely beautiful [[VIDEOID:f6317025f8e45bb2a8e3058aede36694]] The frame is crisp. My video recording doesn\\\\\\'t do justice to the picture quality. The interface is easy to get familiar with, and the underlying OS is Android, big + if you\\\\\\'re already an Android Phone user. Overall, I am very pleased with it, and a great Holiday gift.\\\\n\\'}, data=\\'- B0C2TYZ5LF: Holds s lot of photos Great photo frame!<br />We use an app on our other photo frames. Often while family is in, I\\\\\\'ll snap a few pictures and upload right then. It always makes our family smile as soon as they see the pictures!<br /><br />What we liked:<br />🌟Large storage capacity<br />🌟Plus... No subscription needed!<br />🌟Touch screen HD display and customized settings, such as time zone, autoplay, sleep mode, brightness, volume, sleep mode and auto-rotate setting, this frame can be placed in either portrait or landscape mode, or even mounted on the wall. MUST BE PLUGGED IN.<br />🌟Super easy setup & user friendly with basic understanding of WiFi and smart phone concepts.<br /><br />WHAT WE DIDN\\\\\\'T LIKE<br />On our other digital frames we could play the photo show and mix in our sons racing videos, but on this one we couldn\\\\\\'t do that. It wouldn\\\\\\'t auto play the videos in between the photographs and then move on.<br /><br />My goal is to write honest detailed reviews, let me know if this helped you<br />👇\\\\n- B0BXNK6B1Q: Best Boombox for the money!!! I’m very picky about my audio and video purchases. I read the reviews carefully and compare similar items before making a purchase.  Purchasing the KLIM Boombox B4 was a great pick!!! I read all the product selling points, but they all exceeded my expectations. The sound and volume are more than adequate and clear with enough bass thanks to the equalizer settings. Volume range goes to 30 but is great at 20 or above enough to appreciate what you are hearing. Had an issue with the  Bluetooth mode, but KLIM customer service resolved it in record time, the fastest I’ve ever experienced with any company! The 5 year warranty for this product should be copied by other companies if they think the quality of their product is worth it. I would absolutely buy this item again and I recommend it as a best buy!\\\\n- B0C2TYZ5LF: Great Digital Frame! The setup was very easy.  I was looking at my photos in under 10m after unboxing.<br /><br />PROs:<br />The app is easy to use.<br />Photos are very clear<br />Intuitive UI in-app and on frame<br />Very responsive Touch Screen<br />Easy to Mount/Stand Up<br />Slim Design<br />Can Email Photos, Transfer from App, or use an external Memory Card<br />Can Play Video (with sound--or can be muted)<br />Separate Users from App can be set up to send photos<br />Can label photos with description upon upload.  Can also mass-label multiple photos at once<br />It has a motion sensor so the frame can be set to turn off in the event that no one is in the room (at different intervals, or turned off altogether)<br />Automatic perspective change between portrait and landscape depending on how frame is mounted<br /><br />CONs<br />Can only transfer 50 photos at a time via App<br />Can only transfer 1 video at a time via App<br />When you unplug the frame, you have to go through setup again and select your language/region.  (however, it remembers most everything else)<br />The power cable has a big brick on the end.  Would perhaps be better if it utilized USB or has the brick elsewhere to fit in better tight spaces<br /><br />There are lots of other features here that I haven\\\\\\'t gone over, but these are the main things. Overall I\\\\\\'m very happy with this.  My family has wanted one of these for a while and we are excited to finally have one. I\\\\\\'d recommend this to anyone wanting to explore their first digital photo frame.  The only thing i\\\\\\'d like to be different is to have a larger one, lol\\\\n- B0BXNK6B1Q: Versatile boombox with average sound quality [[VIDEOID:6ed5937277d106df9626614c81946ba4]] I ordered this because we recently found that we didn\\\\\\'t have a CD player or radio anymore and still have a need for those. I found this boombox to be reminiscent of the ones that I remember from when I was younger with some nice new features, Bluetooth and USB capability. It’s also really nice that it comes with a remote control and they include the batteries needed!<br /><br />I like that this can be used cordless so we can take it to the pool or the beach but I haven\\\\\\'t yet tested how well that works or how long the battery life is.<br /><br />The sound quality is just meh. It\\\\\\'s fine but can\\\\\\'t compete with my Bluetooth speakers.<br /><br />The size is larger than the other devices that we use but the CD player necessitates a larger size plus it has a rechargeable battery without being too heavy so I\\\\\\'m fine with it.<br /><br />I found that the radio tuner works well... it\\\\\\'s a digital tuner with a knob. I found that it did locate radio stations automatically if I spun the knob quickly enough. I noticed that the collapsible antenna was necessary for a clear signal from some radio stations but not most.<br /><br />I like that the LCD display is backlit when the unit is on. It definitely made the screen easier to see.<br /><br />I included photos of the user manual because it shows all of the many features and functions of this boombox. I love that it accepts external audio from different sources via Bluetooth and USB. It has an AUX output for listening via headphones.<br /><br />Overall, this boombox has a lot of useful features that I appreciate but I wish it had better sound.\\\\n- B0C2TYZ5LF: Great features but some display inadequacies Quick Summary:<br />Pros:<br />• Wi-fi uploadable files<br />• Multi-window display<br />• Touch screen<br />• Weather feature<br />• Timer and occupancy sensor<br />• User picture upload control<br />• Remote picture uploads<br />Cons:<br />• Color inaccurate<br />• Narrow viewing angle<br />• Low-resolution screen<br /><br />I received this digital picture frame hoping to put our vacation pictures on it.  It was nicely boxed and had both a  quick start guide and a more detailed user manual.<br />This frame has some excellent features, some of which my previous digital frames lacked.<br />WI-FI capabilities.  After installing a free app on our mobile phones, both my GF and I were able to upload pictures.  Giving this frame as a gift and being able to upload images in the background remotely is a feature I have always wanted.  You can load up to 50 at once, which takes a short time, and once uploaded, the frame downloads from the cloud server.  Another item I liked was that I could control whose pictures were displayed.<br />There is the ability to show 1,2,3, or 4 pictures at once; none of my other frames would do this.<br />The local weather information can also be displayed.  There are automatic on and off settings, plus an auto turn on when it senses a person in the room.<br />It has all the standard digital frame features like built-in memory, USB thumb drive capability, video file playback, audio capabilities, and a wired USB connection.<br />There were a few display items that were a deal-breaker for me.  The color reproduction was not accurate.  All my pictures looked chromatically desaturated and tinted towards yellow-green.  I’ve scrutinized several photos and found they were not faithfully reproduced on this frame compared to my desktop computer and my phone.  The display also has a narrow viewing angle.  For example, suppose you are off more than 45 degrees from the center; the picture brightness and chroma saturation/tint change dramatically.  Typically this is caused by the LCD panel.  I read other reviews that pointed out the resolution- 1280x800 is too low, and in most cases, I would agree, but for this application, either using this on a wall or desk, I believe I could deal with that issue, as I am at least 2-3ft away from the frame most of the time.  The low resolution isn’t as noticeable, especially if multiple images are up.<br />Really like all the features this digital display offers, but I cannot give this high marks due to the display chromaticity issues.\\\\n- B0C2TYZ5LF: Looks great! Easy to setup and use! Grandparent \"friendly\" as can be. Allows others to upload photos too.\\\\n- B0C2TYZ5LF: Looks great! Easy to setup and use! Grandparent \"friendly\" as can be. Allows others to upload photos too.\\\\n- B09ZYF8GQQ: Great Product and great customer service Love the simple layout of the buttons, not a cluttered mess of buttons. Remote works very well. Easy to use for setting up.\\\\n- B09ZYF8GQQ: Product met expectations The DVD player is easy to use, and does everything expected. I have not had the player for a long time, so I cannot comment on battery life, but I expect it will be good. Good warranty, and customer service is very good.\\\\n- B09ZYF8GQQ: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️DVD video player [[VIDEOID:2cb97d68f721bda91c3d7ebf840b9adb]] This DVD player has so much flexibility and uses the long life battery make sure that it stays for definitely the length of the video and more, it has a very powerful speaker, it’s easy to operate, the resolution on the screen is unbelievable even though this video shows it with a blue, it is absolutely not blue it is very high quality resolution and the screen is the biggest I’ve had of any video player I’ve ever purchase. This is definitely a five star video player and the customer service from the company I-Geek is so good you can’t pass up this opportunity to purchase the right player from the start. Their help line is very prompt in returning emails to customers. This will go inside any RV car any camper trailer anything, you can use this anywhere, and I can’t say enough good about the size of the screen.\\\\n- B09ZYF8GQQ: NA Awesome value for your money\\\\n- B09ZYF8GQQ: Very easy to use, perfect for kids, high quality Very easy to use, perfect for kids, high quality\\\\n- B09ZYF8GQQ: Good quality We are very satisfied. Nice performance, so far. The image resolution is excellent and the sound is perfect. It is easy to use.\\\\n- B09ZYF8GQQ: Very good for on the go use At first I thought the portability of this product would be hard due to the battery but it turned out to be the complete opposite.<br />The battery life on this thing is amazing, highly recommend for on the go use. Not only that but the Quality of the screen was very high.\\\\n- B09ZYF8GQQ: Impressive! This Video player is ridiculously easy to use. Would be especially great for families with younger children.  It has power cords for either a regular wall outlet or the car’s 12v (cigarette lighter), and the battery easily lasts through a movie anyway.  I use it to watch movies at home without bothering the wife.  Since most laptops now don\\\\\\'t even have DVD drives this comes in really handy!  Highly recommended.\\\\n- B0C2TYZ5LF: 10 out of 10 This is a new and improved digital photo frame. So much better than the ones I have seen that family have had for years and years. It is a 10\" frame which is perfect. Not too big but not too small. It is a touch screen and gives me tablet vibes. It has 32 GB of internal storage which is enough for all my photo\\\\\\'s and I have a lot.<br />I really like the option to download the app and load images on there straight from my mobile device. I also like that you can play videos as well on this frame. I really like also that it has your local weather and clock as well on the home screen.<br />The only downfall I saw was that the directions weren\\\\\\'t as good as I would have liked. It has a basic how-to, but you need to know how to work electronics like this and play around a bit to figure it out on your own.  And may not be the best gift for someone older or not tech-savvy.<br />But for what it is I would recommend it to others. I love that I am able to put it on a shelf or hang it up as well. There are so many great things to say about this.\\\\n- B0C2TYZ5LF: Works well, nice extra options, flexable methods to load photos. Overall this frame does what most people would buy it for. The frame is bright enough to be seen well in most situations.  It has options for how long each picture is displayed, several simple transistions to choose from, and to have the pictures zoom up and crop to fill the screen, or to be \"letterboxed\" to show the entire picture on the screen.<br /><br />The frame can be powered by the included Power adapter plugged into the power port, or powered via the microUSB port using a phone charger or similar. If it does not get enough power from the microUSB port it will \"stall\" and not finish booting.<br /><br />Setting up the frame is easy, it is a touch screen, it walks you through connecting to your WiFi, naming the frame, and presents a QR code to get the software, as well as a QR code that changes on a regular basis to \"pair\" your phone with the frame so you have control and some security over how/who can upload pictures to the frame.<br /><br />Options for getting pictures onto the frame are to:<br />* Use the app, copying pictures directly from your phone to the frame (your phone and frame must be on the same WiFi network while yo do this.)<br />* Email, you can have frame and associated service setup to accept photos as attachments via email.<br />* Direct connect to computer, Using the micro USB port on the frame you can connect the frame to a compiuter, it shows up similar to a digital camera allowing you to copy pictures directly to the frame.<br />* MicroSD card, you can put pictures on a microSD card, and just plug the card into the frame.<br />* USB drive, the frame has a USB type A (USB 2.0?) you can put pictures on a USB drive and plug it in.<br /><br /> However, It does *NOT* have a \"cloud storage\" mode where you could give it to grandpa/grandma and just upload photos to the cloud that the frame will display. However you could set your own email address  up as \"approved\" and email pictures to the frame as attachments.<br /><br />When using the MicroSD card and USB drive, you can have the frame copy the pictues into it\\\\\\'s internal storage (16 GB) or simply display pictues directly from the plugged in drives.<br /><br />The frame can display video and sound as well. The sound quality is fair (missing a lot of bass and tinny, hey, it\\\\\\'s a picture frame, not a sound system) the volume does not go extremely high, but was slightly louder than I expected.<br /><br />It also claims to play videos. At 10\" with quite tinny sound lacking a lot of bass, I\\\\\\'d not call it a cinematic experience, but for showing short videos taken with a camera phone it\\\\\\'s quite good. Videos are limited to 200 Mb each.<br /><br />The frame includes a motion sensor, so it can turn itself off when no one is near to save power. And it senses it\\\\\\'s orientation to display photos correctly when rotated on it\\\\\\'s side or upside down.<br /><br />Pictures that are not oriented correctly can be rotated while being displayed, and the frame remembers the fix so the picutre will from then on be right side up.<br /><br />Storage: 16 GB is quite a bit for photo storage, and the option to add up to an additional 32 GB in the form of a microSD card is nice. (How I use it, I put my pics on a micros SD card, plug it in and away it goes.)<br /><br />It does have the option to create folders of pictures so you can have seperate slideshows that it can cycle through; pictures of the kids for when grandparents visit, or just scenery when you are tired of the kids?<br /><br />Overall, it\\\\\\'s a good solid product, it works as advertised with some nice extra features. I really like it on my desk at work to show pics of my family and kids.\\\\n- B0BXNK6B1Q: Great CD player This is a great little unit.
